Text Analysis and Data Visualization of WhatsApp Chats

Objective
To generate a full fledged report or a detailed analysis on chats over the WhatsApp application and visualize it using Python. This will help teachers, employers, marketing professionals and personnel of other fields to determine the most active time period, level of engagement and behavioral patterns in their students, employees or overall audience.
A WhatsApp group chat is often composed of a handful number of group admins and multiple members to form a group. From academics to daily office work, WhatsApp has played an immense role in smoothening the communication lines between each and every manner with its easy, seamless UI, end-to-end encryption and sharing functionalities. However, quite often when a group chat is active, it could stray out of topic or with time, the group proceeds towards a dead end.
With this project, we analyze the chats and visualize its stats in a comprehensive manner to help teachers, leaders, employers etc determine which part of the day is the best time period to push an important message without it getting lost in the conversation. 

Not only this, the detailed analysis of the messages can help the teachers determine if there are any hints of any inappropriate behaviour from their students or to determine when is the most active time to push a discussion through, amongst their pupils.
